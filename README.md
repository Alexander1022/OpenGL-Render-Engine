# 3D Render Engine using OpenGL
> This is a project with which I aim to learn OpenGL and graphics rendering at all. <br />
> At this moment the project is not running like a normal application as it is still early in development. <br />
> My goal is to achieve something close to the "Marmoset toolbag" rendering software. <br />

## How to run the project
The project is build using CMake.

At this moment the project uses resources from a hardcoded path to the folder `Source/Application/resources`. <br />
It is not mandatory to have this folder as only the 3D models and textures are loaded from there.

You can find this folder at `add download link later` <br />

## Navigation
When you run the project you will be greated with a black screen. Don't worry, the object will pop up the moment you start moving the camera <br />

### Camera controls:
**Hold right click inside the window to enter the camera control <br />
Move mouse to rotate the camera <br />
W, A, S, D to move camera around**<br />
