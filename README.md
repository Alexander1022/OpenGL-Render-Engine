# 3D Render Engine using OpenGL
> This is a project with which I aim to learn OpenGL and graphics rendering at all. <br />
> At this moment the project is not running like a normal application as it is still early in development. <br />
> My goal is to achieve something close to the "Marmoset toolbag" rendering software. <br />

## How to run the project
The project is build using CMake. <br />
At this moment the project uses resources from a hardcoded path to the folder Source/Application/resources. <br />
It is not mandatory to have this folder as only the 3D models and textures are loaded from there. <br />
You can find this folder at 'add download link later' <br />
